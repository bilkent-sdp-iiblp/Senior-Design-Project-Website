# Immersive Inquiry-Based Learning Platform

Welcome to our **Senior Design Project**. 

## Project Overview

Inquiry-based learning is a type of learning in which students explore a subject by answering a series of guiding questions. Through this process, they come to understand the material as if they had discovered it themselves. Unfortunately unlike normal textbooks, Inquiry-Based Learning textbooks require an instructor to guide the student through the learning process. This in the past has meant that Inquiry-Based learning had been impossible to implement in the classic online lecture form. But the existence of LLM's have made it possible for such textbooks to be utilized in self-learning through the assistance of an LLM instructor. In such a setup students will be given the ability to upload an IBL Textbook and an LLM will create an online course out of that book. The LLM will guide the students through a series of questions and in the end students will be made to learn the subject as if they have discovered it themselves. To further enhance this experience, the system will incorporate animated embodiments of the instructor, complete with synchronized synthesized speech. These animated agents will use facial expressions, gestures, posture, and gaze to convey personality and presence, making the interaction feel more engaging and immersive. By combining IBL with expressive character animations, students will not only learn as if they had discovered the material themselves, but also feel as if they are being guided by a real instructor in a vivid and interactive environment.
